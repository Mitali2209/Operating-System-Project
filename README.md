# Operating-System-Project
A real-time Deadlock Detection, Prevention, and Recovery Toolkit that lets users simulate deadlock scenarios with custom inputs. It visualizes resource allocation using graphs and implements algorithms like Banker’s Algorithm. Users can detect cycles, avoid unsafe states, and apply recovery strategies interactively.
